1. Set current to 0
2. Loop (until last element sorted)
	1. Set smallest to current
	2. Set walker to current + 1
	3. Loop (walker <= last)
		1. if (walker key < smallest key)
		2. incremetn walker 
	4. end loop
	5. exchange (current, smallest)
	6. increment current
3. end loop

Time Complexity: O(n2) as there are two nested loops.
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
